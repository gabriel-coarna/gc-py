GC-PY: Just another Python web-framework
========================================

So what makes this special?
===========================

Well, in short, nothing other than the fact that it's mine.
Which means that, when I use it, it makes me feel like the driver of whatever app I'm building, instead of just a passenger in someone else's car.

That not-in-control feeling you get when in the right seat of someone else's car is the feeling I get when I'm not in full control of my stack.
I dislike that feeling. A lot.


Disclaimer:
===========

(1)
I've just switched to Python for web-development, but I'm not new to the language itself.
I've spent quite a bit of time looking over all the web-frameworks available, and (predictably) have decided that I like none of them. (Sidenote: We programmers really like to re-invent the wheel evey chance we get, don't we?)

(2)
This is not just an exercise in creativity / framework-design / time-wasting.
I have a very specific app in mind, and I'll be building this framework with the end-goal of having it help me build that app.

Use / watch / read at your own risk.
I may be totally wrong about anything / everything that ends up going into this project.
